### MySQL vs PostgreSQL
| MySQL | PostgreSQL |
|:-------|:------------|
|The MySQL project has made its source code available under the terms of the GNU License, and other proprietary agreements.	| PostgreSQL is released under PostgreSQL License.|
|It's now owned by Oracle Corporation and offers several paid editions.	| It's free and open-source software. That means you will never need to pay anything for this service.|
|MySQL is ACID compliant only when using with NDB and InnoDB Cluster Storage engines. | PostgreSQL is completely ACID compliant.|
|MySQL performs well in OLAP and OLTP systems where only read speed is important.	| PostgreSQL performance works best in systems which demand the execution of complex queries.|
|MySQL is reliable and works well with BI (Business Intelligence) applications, which are difficult to read	| PostgreSQL works well with BI applications. However, it is more suited for Data Warehousing and data analysis applications which need fast read-write speeds.|
