### What is Yii Model-View-Controller architecture?
MVC schema

![img](/image/mvc_schema.png)
1. `Model`
>defines relations among data in DB and rules that must be followed when saving data to DB. It also gives us tools to read/save data from/to DB.

2. `View`
>shows data to user. It doesn’t write to DB or count difficult things. It just receives data and shows them using HTML, CSS, JS, etc.

3. `Controller`
>processes and changes the data, handles user’s actions, decides, counts, thinks and calls models and views. It simply acts.
