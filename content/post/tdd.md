### What is TDD?
![img](/image/tdd.gif)

>Before writing any code that adds new functionality to an application, the developer first writes an automated test describing how the new code should behave, and watches it turn red (fail to pass). 

>They then write the code to the specification, and the test turns green (it passes).

>Finally, the developer takes a little time to make sure that the code just written is as clean as possible (refactoring).


### Advantages o TDD
1. TDD helps to prevent bugs  
2. Self Explanatory code  
3. Advoid he bugger debugger problem  
>When talking tech about software development, there are two main types of testing that can be integrated: functional and non-functional.

>Unit and Integration tests to be performed by developers before handing out builds to testers

>User acceptance testing to be performed by the testers

>Performance testing and UI testing should be done by both

4. You can forecast troubles  
>The benefit of a comprehensive test suite is that it alerts you to changes early.
5. Save Money

When code is complicated, it gets much harder to get anything done — one little change over here can result in a big problem over there. 
When following TDD, developers can make changes with confidence and your QA team will catch fewer regressions. 
In development speak, `time saved is equal to money earned`.

6. Invest the saved time in innovations and research

7. TDD Helps You Avoid Scope Creep
>The nightmare of any project manager is scope creep — any unexpected growth in the scope of work which leads to delays in project delivery.

>Scope creep can happen for various reasons: poorly defined tasks, misinterpretation of project requirements, lack of documentation, and so on. There are many methods aimed at mitigating scope creep, and `TDD` is one of them.
