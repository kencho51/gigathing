- **Disqus**: Requires cookie consent, tracks user behavior, complex GDPR compliance

#### **Mobile Performance**

The choice in 2025 ultimately depends on your priorities: if you value privacy, performance, and modern features, **Giscus** is the clear winner. If you need advanced AI features and don't mind the privacy trade-offs, **Disqus** remains viable for enterprise use cases.
